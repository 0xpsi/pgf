GLFW is the primary library to use opengl with,

~~~~~ For Linux ~~~~~
  - download glfw source
  - while in root dir, run
  > cmake . && make
  - libglfw3.a will be in glfw src/ dir, copy that to local project lib directory
  - linking rule of thumb: more dependant libs should go first, simpler ones go last

  
~~~~ For Windows ~~~~
  - Don't bother trying to compile GLFW, get binaries
  - I have found TDM-GCC-64 to work as mingw compiler
